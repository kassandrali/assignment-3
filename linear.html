        <div class="text1">While most modern dice are cube-shaped, many dice thought to have been used in ancient times have been excavated in the form of sticks, which inspired the creation of three types of dice that bear the numbers by means of sticks that branch radially from the center.

            Four sticks stand at three points to bear the numbers “1 to 4”.
            Six sticks stand with three points to bear the numbers “1 to 8”.
            Eight sticks stand with four points to bear the numbers “1 to 6”.
            
            The goal was to bring a new sensation to familiar uses and actions, including the impression of holding the dice in one’s hand and the way they roll after being thrown, by deliberately reconstructing the dice with “lines” instead of the conventional “surfaces”.</div>
